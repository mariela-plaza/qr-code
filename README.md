## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vite
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I practiced using a lot of css properties, particularly media queries to make the design work adequately for both Desktop and Mobile.

### Continued development

I would love to learn more and use css grid. Although I didn't use it in this project (I used flexbox) I know it is an interesting tool that I'd like to learn more about.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp) - This is a great resource to refresh my memoty on css media queries syntax.
